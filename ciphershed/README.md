## On July 8th, 2014 the TCNext project announced that new versions of TrueCrypt would be called CipherShed:

> A new name has been chosen. 
> As most have found out, for legal reasons names that contain crypt of true are not a good choice. 
> Also most of the domain names have been taken and trademarks or restrictions apply to most other names.
> The team has chosen the product name "CipherShed" for the new truecrypt-functionality application.
